Hello my name is **Christopher Lowe** I a'm in the middle on my Udacity front-end development course , and and this repo is one of the items I need to submit for review.

##Things left to do.

1. Make the page full width
2. add a menu when more content is added
3. add a video or slidding banner to the top of the page

The most important this i have lernt by creating this page is to make my code readable, not only for me but for others too.
